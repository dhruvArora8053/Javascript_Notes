/////////////////////////////////////////////////
//AJAX calls:

//traditional way:
const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
//this is a old sochool way of doing AJAX in javascript but we still showing it for 2 reasons:
//1. xml http request exists because you might need it in the future
//2. we want to show you how ajax calls used to be handled with events and callback functions

//next we need the url to which we will make the ajax call:
request.open('GET', 'https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/portugal');
//1st argument: type of request
//2nd argument: url to which that ajax call should be made

//with above we basically opened the request and now next we need to also send it:
request.send();
//so this will now send off the request to the abouve url

//now inorder to get the result we couldn't simply do something like this:
// const data= request.send();
//basically to set some variable to this result here and the reason why we cannot do this is because the result is simply not there yet so this ajax call that we just send off here is being done in the background while the rest of the code keep running and so this is the ansynchronous non-blocking behavior that we talked about

console.log(request.responseText); //nothing
//so instead what we need to do is to register a callback on the request object for the load event:
request.addEventListener('load', function () {
  console.log(this.responseText);
  //this keyword inside of this function is the 'request' so we could also use 'request' keyword and then response is in the responseText and again this responseText property here is ofcourse only gonna be ser once the data has actually arrived and this property outside of the callback won't work

  //convert data to object:
  const [data] = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
  console.log(data);

  const html = `<article class="country">
  <img class="country__img" src="${data.flags.png}" />
  <div class="country__data">
    <h3 class="country__name">${data.name.common}</h3>
    <h4 class="country__region">${data.region}</h4>
    <p class="country__row"><span>üë´</span>${(
      +data.population / 1000000
    ).toFixed(1)}M people</p>
    <p class="country__row"><span>üó£Ô∏è</span>${data.languages.por}</p>
    <p class="country__row"><span>üí∞</span>${data.currencies.EUR.name}</p>
  </div>
</article>`;

  countriesContainer.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', html);
  countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
});
//so basically request.send() send off the request and so that request then fetches the data in the background and then once that is done, it will emit the load event and so using this event listener we are waiting for that event and so as soon as the data arrives this callback function here will be called

//so this was the our first ajax call and this looks like a bunch of data about India now we just need to convert this data to an actual javascript object because what we have here right now is json so remember that json is basically just a big string of text so what we need to do here is to then convert that

//Making above code to a function:
const getCountryData = function (country) {
  const request = new XMLHttpRequest();

  request.open('GET', `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/${country}`);

  request.send();

  request.addEventListener('load', function () {
    const [data] = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
    console.log(data);

    const html = `<article class="country">
  <img class="country__img" src="${data.flags.png}" />
  <div class="country__data">
    <h3 class="country__name">${data.name.common}</h3>
    <h4 class="country__region">${data.region}</h4>
    <p class="country__row"><span>üë´</span>${(
      +data.population / 1000000
    ).toFixed(1)}M people</p>
    <p class="country__row"><span>üó£Ô∏è</span>${data.languages.eng}</p>
    <p class="country__row"><span>üí∞</span>${data.currencies.name}</p>
  </div>
</article>`;

    countriesContainer.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', html);
    countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;
  });
};

getCountryData('portugal');
getCountryData('bharat');

//And now if we reload this page here a couple of times then they might appear in a different order and the reason for that is basically that the data arrives at a slightly different time each that we're loading the page and so infact this really shows the non-blocking behavior in action so here as we called getCountryData here with portugal for the very first time it sends off this request and then javascript moves on in the code right away and so it goes right here to the next line and this ofcourse fires off another ajax call immediately way before the data of portugal has actually arrived so again we will have two ajax call happening at the same time and so whatever one arrives first will then fire the load event first
