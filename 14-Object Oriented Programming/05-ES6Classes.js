//Now as we mentioned earlier classes in javascript do not work like traditional classes in other languages like Java or C++ so instead classes in javascript are just synthetic sugar over what we learned in these last sections. So they still implement prototypal inheritance behing the scenes but with a syntax that makes more sense to people coming from othe programming languages and so that was basically the goal of adding classes to javascript:

//class expression
const PersonCl = class{
    
}

//class declaration
class PersonCl{

}
