// Coding Challenge #2
// Let's continue with our football betting app! Keep using the 'game' variable from
// before.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the console,
// along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
// 2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We already
// studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)
// 3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exactly like this:
// Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33
// Odd of draw: 3.25
// Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
// Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them
// (except for "draw"). Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have the
// same property names �
// 4. Bonus: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the
// players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this
// game, it will look like this:
// {
//  Gnarby: 1,
//  Hummels: 1,
//  Lewandowski: 2
// }
// GOOD LUCK

// So the solution is to loop over the array, and add the array elements as object properties, and then increase the count as we encounter a new occurence of a certain element
